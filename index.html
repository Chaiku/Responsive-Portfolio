                    <p>Welcome, fellow web traveller, to my humble homepage. My name is Adam and I've just begun my journey in to coding with Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp and I'm very excited. I'm learning that practice really does make perfect, and the more I code the more muscle memory for it I develop. Looking forward to coming back and re-doing this whole site cleaner, better, and more efficient than right now.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In my spare time you can usually find me playing drums or spending time with my friends both physically and virtually. I love spending time hiking outdoors and playing multiplayer games. Some of my favorite hiking spots here in Georgia include: Sweetwater State Park, Red Top Mountain State Park, and Wormsloe Historic Plantation over in Savannah, GA. Some of my favorite games currently are League of Legends and World of Warcraft, however I'm doing my best to resist the urge to play while I'm in this course!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hoping to learn as much as I can during my time in this course and that I can get going back in the world on a new career track. Web development feels like a means to really do something useful and also a great field in which I can continue learning constantly. I am very excited for what the future may hold and planning to work hard to achieve my goals!</p>
